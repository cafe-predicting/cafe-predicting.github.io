<u>Week of 2/14/16 - 2/20/16</u>
<p>This week, we met after class on Wednesday and Friday to discuss the type of relations each of us were looking at in our data in order to find trends for our predictive models.</p>
<p>Throughout the week I have been looking at the raw data on Excel as well as using Java to parse through the different .csv files and combine different sets of data. I then outputted this data into new .csv files and used Excel to find trends with the combined data.</p>
<p>On Friday we decided to have found our trends by early next week and email them to the customer for approval.</p>

<u>Week of 2/7/16 - 2/13/16</u>
<p>This week, we met after class to discuss the requirements for our project and the plan moving forward. We each sent a list of what we believed to be the requirements to Cory who then compiled the list and forwared it to the client, Dr. Whitney, on Tuesday.</p>
<p>On Monday I set up the Github project profile and started our project webpage. Dr. Whitney then approved our requirements we had sent by Wednesday, which were then added to the webpage. After class on Friday, we discussed the overall theme of the website which I implemented the basics of by Friday and continued tweaking over the weekend. Content for the project's abstract, description, requirements, schedule, and activities were added by Friday.</p>
<p>After class on Friday we met and decided for the coming week to review the cafe data and each identify our own possible trends to submit to the customer.</p>
