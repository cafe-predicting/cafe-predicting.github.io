<u>Week of 3/28/16 - 4/3/16</u>
<p>This week I finished my regression model algorithm using M5Prime to create a predictor that is able to predict the amount of customers in the cafeteria at a given time
based on the current weather and other factors. The model has a final accuracy of 88.3%. I made little progress with my second predictor, the ability to predic if a customer will
purchase a healthy food item based on gender, age, day of the week, weather, and the current advertised item. Its accuracy is only about 71% still.</p>
<p>I also began working on our Shiny app which will be our web-based dashboard for the algorithms. I created the URL the app will be hosted on and uploaded a basic app that contains an
interactive version of my weather predictor.</p>
<p>Cory also created a test plan for our application and uploaded it to the projec site.</p>

<u>Week of 3/21/16 - 3/27/16</u>
<p>The team met briefly after class on Monday to discuss progress on our algorithms.</p>
<p>I worked on both of my algorithms and was able to get my weather predictor to around 80% accuracy and my healthy predictor to around 70%.</p>
<p>The team's goals for the following week is to finish up the work on our algorithms and begin to create our dashboard to display them.</p>

<u>Week of 3/14/16 - 3/20/16</u>
<p>Over break I worked on my two algorithms for predicting amount of customers based on time and weather and predicting the amount of healthy food a person will purchase.</p>
<p>As this week was spring break the team did not meet.</p>

<u>Week of 3/7/16 - 3/13/16</u>
<p>We presented our project to Dr. Piwowarski and the class on Wednesday and discussed after class what our goals were to accomplish over spring break.</p>

<u>Week of 2/28/16 - 3/6/16</u>
<p>This week, we met with Dr. Piwowarski to discuss the state of our project on Wednesday. After the meeting the group worked together on creating our presentation for eStudio and
the in-class presentation next week. We then presented our presentation to eStudio Thursday afternoon, making changes to it Thursday and Friday. Over the weekend we discussed our project's
design and what part each team member will be doing.</p>

<u>Week of 2/21/16 - 2/27/16</u>
<p>This week, we met after class on Monday and Wednesday to discuss trends we have found in the data or share what each of us are focusing on. Chris is going to focus on trends
found in customer purchases based on advertising, Cory is going to focus on customer demographic trends based on the time of day or day of week, and I've decided to focus on trends
with the purchase of certain food items based on the time of day, day of week, weather, and customer demographic, as well as possibly the amount of people in the cafe based on time of day, day of week, or weather.</p>
<p>This week and weekend I've further developed my Java program that's helping me parse the data to find trends. I've converted parts of it to then output certain data back out as a CSV file
in order to open in Excel and more closely examine the data. I have also converted the program to parse all the data into a MySQL server database so that I can more efficiently run queries on the data.</p>

<u>Week of 2/14/16 - 2/20/16</u>
<p>This week, we met after class on Wednesday and Friday to discuss the type of relations each of us were looking at in our data in order to find trends for our predictive models.</p>
<p>Throughout the week I have been looking at the raw data on Excel as well as using Java to parse through the different .csv files and combine different sets of data. I then outputted this data into new .csv files and used Excel to find trends with the combined data.</p>
<p>On Friday we decided to have found our trends by early next week and email them to the customer for approval.</p>

<u>Week of 2/7/16 - 2/13/16</u>
<p>This week, we met after class to discuss the requirements for our project and the plan moving forward. We each sent a list of what we believed to be the requirements to Cory who then compiled the list and forwared it to the client, Dr. Whitney, on Tuesday.</p>
<p>On Monday I set up the Github project profile and started our project webpage. Dr. Whitney then approved our requirements we had sent by Wednesday, which were then added to the webpage. After class on Friday, we discussed the overall theme of the website which I implemented the basics of by Friday and continued tweaking over the weekend. Content for the project's abstract, description, requirements, schedule, and activities were added by Friday.</p>
<p>After class on Friday we met and decided for the coming week to review the cafe data and each identify our own possible trends to submit to the customer.</p>
