<u>Week of 3/27/16-4/2/16</u>
<br>
This week, I continued to work on establishing a functional predictive model for customer populations throughout the week, without much success. I’ve become familiar with several regression techniques, but none of them are practical for establishing a model based on the data we’ve been given. First, customer populations tend to follow a polynomial distribution throughout the day, which is not easily reducible for applying regression. Second, despite the number of data points we’ve been provided, the data that I’m using to make my predictions is largely inconsistent, and only covers a few weeks of cafe operation, making accurate predictions even more difficult. For these reasons, I must reconsider my approach for establishing a model of customer populations.

On an unrelated note, I also used Sunday to create a test plan for our web application, which I then uploaded to the project website.

<u>Weeks of 3/13/16 - 3/26/16</u>
<br>
Since last week was spring break for the University of Kentucky, I’m including activities from last week and this week in this update. Over break, I began to work on familiarizing myself with R and RStudio, working on the basics of I/O and R scripts, while exploring the capabilities of the language in regards to handling the data points I’ve selected for the project. Once classes resumed, the team set a goal to work on establishing our predictive models within a week or two. Unfortunately, I was a bit stymied in establishing a practical model this week. I updated my parser to include additional useful information and added a lot of documentation to the code, but I’ll need to perform more research on multiple nonlinear regression in order to establish a functional predictive model in the coming days.

<u>Week of 3/6/16 - 3/12/16</u>
<br>
On Sunday, the team completed the project design document. Specifically, I wrote up the abstract, gave a summary of machine learning, detailed the development environment, created a diagram of the project’s modules, listed some design considerations, added the team’s trend charts, and compiled the other team member’s design sections into a single document, which was then linked to the project webpage. On Tuesday, I added a slide about our development environment to the presentation we prepared last week, as suggested by Ryan. On Wednesday, the team delivered the presentation to our classmates and class instructor.

<u>Week of 2/28/16 - 3/5/16</u>
<br>
The team met with instructor Piwowarski Wednesday afternoon to discuss the team’s progress with the project and within the class. After the meeting, the team convened to discuss individual responsibilities for the upcoming midterm presentation practice. I drew up a list of topics that needed to be covered with estimates of how long it would take to discuss each topic. We then split up the topics so that each of the three team members had roughly the same amount of responsibility in preparing and delivering the presentation.
<br><br>
Wednesday evening, I developed graphs to represent the data trends I had chosen to focus on and prepared a summary of machine learning. I also compiled Chris and Ryan’s slides with my own to finish the slideshow presentation. On Thursday afternoon, the team met at the eStudio to deliver our presentation for review, after which the reviewer gave us suggestions to improve the presentation for delivery in class the following week. On Saturday evening, I finished incorporating the reviewer’s suggestions into the slideshow.

<u>Week of 2/21/16 - 2/27/16</u>
<br>
On Monday, Ryan and I discussed our individual focuses for the project, and on Wednesday, the team met briefly to establish the direction each of us would take in exploring trends and relationships in the cafe customer data. On Thursday, I had the other team members email a statement about their focuses before sending an update to the client about our progress and direction. On Friday, and Saturday, I started to examine the framework for the project design.

<u>Week of 2/14/16 - 2/20/16</u>
<br>
This week, the team focused on identifying trends in the cafe data and examining relationships between various elements of the data set. Using some simple C++ code to parse the data along with Microsoft Excel's chart making tools, I examined various customer populations at different points in the day and different days of the week. For instance, aside from obvious spikes in customer activity during breakfast and lunch hours, I observed a disproportionately lower number of a particular age group in the morning compared to the rest of the day. My focus for the project will to be to further analyze these trends and predict customer demophraphic populations on the basis of various factors.

<u>Week of 2/7/16 - 2/13/16</u>
<br>
This week, our team met after class on Monday to discuss what we interpreted as the requirements for the project. By Tuesday evening, each of us proposed a list of specifications for the project individually, which I compiled before emailing to the the client, Dr. Julie Whitney, for review. Dr. Whitney sent her approval of the specifications the next morning, providing us with a concrete set of goals to work towards. The team met once again after class on Friday to discuss our personal responsibilities, and set some goals for the following week. In the coming week, we are to individually review the cafe data and identify trends.
