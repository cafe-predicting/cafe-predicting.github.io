<u>Week of 2/21/16 - 2/27/16</u>
<br>
On Monday, Ryan and I discussed our individual focuses for the project, and on Wednesday, the team met briefly to establish the direction each of us would take in exploring trends and relationships in the cafe customer data. On Thursday, I had the other team members email a statement about their focuses before sending an update to the client about our progress and direction. On Friday, and Saturday, I started to examine the framework for the project design.

<u>Week of 2/14/16 - 2/20/16</u>
<br>
This week, the team focused on identifying trends in the cafe data and examining relationships between various elements of the data set. Using some simple C++ code to parse the data along with Microsoft Excel's chart making tools, I examined various customer populations at different points in the day and different days of the week. For instance, aside from obvious spikes in customer activity during breakfast and lunch hours, I observed a disproportionately lower number of a particular age group in the morning compared to the rest of the day. My focus for the project will to be to further analyze these trends and predict customer demophraphic populations on the basis of various factors.

<u>Week of 2/7/16 - 2/13/16</u>
<br>
This week, our team met after class on Monday to discuss what we interpreted as the requirements for the project. By Tuesday evening, each of us proposed a list of specifications for the project individually, which I compiled before emailing to the the client, Dr. Julie Whitney, for review. Dr. Whitney sent her approval of the specifications the next morning, providing us with a concrete set of goals to work towards. The team met once again after class on Friday to discuss our personal responsibilities, and set some goals for the following week. In the coming week, we are to individually review the cafe data and identify trends.
