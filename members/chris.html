<u>Week of 4/4/16-4/10/16</u>
<p>The team met with Dr. Piwowarski on Wednesday 4/6 to discuss testing plans and details. The team also met briefly following this meeting to discuss progress and gathing individual code sections for code review the next week.</p>
<p>This week I began working on modifying our Java-based parser to create a new .csv containing sales by customer instead of by item. I believe this will both improve the success rate of my algorithms and more accuratly reflect my intended problem. Progress on this has been slow as I am new to Java and still learning its features. I plan to complete the modifications early this week so I can begin running the new customers.csv data through my algorithms.</p>
<u>Week of 3/28/16 - 4/3/16</u>
<p>The team did not meet this week due to individual focusing on our personal sections. We did discuss via email details of the testing aspect of our project. Cory volunteered to writeup our ideas into the testing plan.</p>
<p>I spent this week working further with both Bayes networks and the c5.0 decision tree algorithm. By modifying the supplied input data to remove extraneous variables, I have been able to achieve highly accurate predictions with the naive baysian network; my most recent model achieved 100% accuracy, likely there is a fault as this is too good to be true. On the other end of the spectrum, the data that I am currently working with has a very low chance of having outcome 2 occur. This results in the c5.0 algorithm just guessing outcome 1 for all cases, which is an automatic 92% accuracy. I plan to modify my data set this week and attempt to create a successful c5.0 predictor.</p>
<u>Week of 3/21/16 - 3/27/16</u>
<p>The team met briefly on Monday 3/21 to discuss predictor goals and the implementation of the final dashboard.</p>
<p>I spent most of my time this week working with my initial predictor and parser attempting to increase the accurcy of my predictor to the desired >80%. I have plans to try a decision tree model in addition to my current naive bayes network model.</p>
<u>Week of 3/14/16 - 3/20/16</u>
<p>This week was spring break for the University of Kentucky. We had no classes and also did not feel it necessary to meet this week.</p>
<p>I spent time over the break working with our project data and the machine-learning in R. I began using different methods to generate predictions of my data. I have decided which machine-learning algorithm I will use to implement my predictor.</p>
<u>Week of 3/7/16 - 3/13/16</u>
<p>The team presented on our project and progress to Dr. Piwowarski and our classmates on Wednesday 3/9. The team met breifly following the class to discuss goals for the next week.</p>
<p>I spent the early part of this week practicing and putting finishing touches on our presentation. After the presentation, I began to familiarize myself with the machine-learning capabilities of R, the language I decided to use for generating my prediction algorithm.</p>
<u>Week of 2/29/16 - 3/6/16</u>
<p>The team met with Dr. Piwowarski for a project status check-up. The team met after the check-up to layout the midterm presentation and design. The team met with the eStudio on Thrusday 3/3 for a practice presentation.</p>
<p>I spent time this week compiling graphics for the midterm presentation and constructing my secton of it. I spent time during the weekend compiling my section of the design documentation.</p>
<u>Week of 2/22/16 - 2/28/16</u>
<p>The team met after class Wednesday 2/24 to finalize individual trends of interest. These were included in an update sent to the customer early Thursday 2/25.</p>
<p>I spent a majority of time this week parsing the customer's data and studying my trend of interest. I spent some time this weekend attempting to generate graphical representations for presentation next week.</p>
<u>Week of 2/15/16 - 2/21/16</u>
<p>The team met after class Monday 2/15 to determine the goal of this week: To investigate the customer's data for trends to model. We decided to determine what trends each member would investigate to be sent for customer approval next week.</p>
<p>I spent some time this week looking at data to find a trend to follow. Unfortunately,due ti other responsibilities, I had not determined yet determined my trend for the team meeting Friday 2/20. The team decided to update the customer on our progress and trends by Wednesday 2/24.</p>
<u>Week of 2/8/16 - 2/14/16</u>
<p>The team met for a few minutes after class on Monday 2/8 to discuss project requirements. It was decided that we would compile a list to be sent to our customer for approval. I reviewed our initial draft and added a few comments. The requirements were approved by the customer and added to the website on Wednesday 2/10.</p>
<p>The team met for a few minutes after class on Friday 2/12 to discuss the website theme and set goals for the following week. Friday evening and over the weekend I provided input and recommendations on the details of the website layout and theme.</p>
